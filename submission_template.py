"""Build graph simulator challenge — submission template.

Implement build_all() to build all targets in the graph as fast as possible.

Rules:
- You must call target.build() for each target — do not skip or replace it.
- Every target must be built exactly once.
- A target must not be built until all of its dependencies have completed.
